<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Description:</span></h3>

<p> A turn-based RPG game that discusses the relationship between nature and human.
Scene 1:
This land is called the land of Tataris, in this land, people believe in the god “Tu di Shen”.

Tu Di Shen blesses the village that believes in him and blesses people with better quality vegetables, fruits, etc.

The player will act as an ordinary person “Kiki” who left the village to work in a modern city, and in cities, people make use of technology to enhance their life, rather than believing in Tu Di Shen.
 The player is earning a lot more money than what he would earn in the village, but the player is tired of the social network he needs to maintain to live in modern society. 

One day, the player was fired by his boss because the player stepped into his office with his left foot first instead of his right foot, as Kiki could not take such a reason, the player decided to take a break from modern life and return to the village where Kiki grows up.

The player encountered some wolves on his way home.
[this battle will act as a tutorial to help the player understand the battling system.]
 After a couple of battles, right before the player gets home, the player encounters a small boss fight, where the leading wolf is shining with dark sparkles.
[the player is rewarded with an item called “big dark tooth” after winning the battle]

The player heads back to the village and the villagers greeted the player with natural goodies such as wild berry juice, etc. 
[some relaxed scene of the player enjoying the natural good for some time.]

A couple of days later, the player's parents explained to the player that in the village, they keep the tradition of going to the dark caves to collect mythical essence to worship the Tu Di Shen in order to receive the blessing.

[First cave fight, there will be items and gears conveniently hiding in every cave.]
After the fight, the player levels up and collects a bunch of mythical essences.
The player heads toward the shrine and worships the essence of the Tu Di Shen.
The Tu Di Shen grants the player some great quality goodies and explains that the player gets to learn battling skills through the shrine using the essences.

[game progresses, the player heading to the second cave fight]
[second cave fight, not much difference than the first one despite being a bit harder.]

[third cave fight, not much difference than the second one despite being a bit harder.]
During the third cave fight, the player will not only counter the darkening spirits that the player usually faces but there are also some darken-ordinary animals that aggressively attack the player.

The player noticed the abnormal situation and notified Tu Di Shen about this along with the wolf encounters the player had at the beginning of the game.

Tu Di Shen explains to the player that he started to feel the loss of power these days, and there might be something wrong with his power fountain that caused the animals to act abnormally. 

The player decides to find out what’s wrong with the power fountain.

[more battles encountered on the way.]

As soon as the player sees the power fountain, the player noticed that the fountain has been drained, and after some more battles, the player encounters a red-colored Tu Di Shen draining the essences from the fountain.
(The Tu Di Shen from the player’s village is green-colored)

The player immediately asks the red Tu Di Shen what’s going on here, and the Red Tu Di Shen answered the player with a surprise attack,

[For this battle, the player stands no chance as the Tu Di Shen is level 80 while the player is about level 20.]

The player quickly loses the battle, but the green Tu Di Shen showed up and saved the player right before the player passes out.

The player woke up, and the green Tu Di Shen explains that the Red Tu Di Shen is the Tu Di Shen of a nearby village, Red village, he has no idea why the red Tu Di Shen is stealing the power from him, but this was the reason why the green Tu Di Shen lost a lot his power.

The player decided to pay a visit to the Red village.

[more battles on the way to the red village]

The red village looks like a metal base compared to the green village, the village is filled with iron walls, cameras, motor vehicles, etc.

The player was greeted by the red villagers and toured the villages, where the player finds that every villager seems quite happy and appreciated the technology by the company called “Fantastia”.

The player then discovered that the red villagers has abandoned the shrine for the red Tu Di Shen, as they believe that the technology would serve them better rather than a Tu Di Shen.

The player enters the shrine.
[more battles.]

The player sees the red Tu Di Shen.
[the second battle with red Tu Di Shen, but the Tu Di Shen is only level 40 this time, which is about the same for the player.]

Red Tu Di Shen explains to the player that he’s kept losing his power as the villagers stopped worshiping him with mythical essences, so, in order to survive, he has to steal the power from green Tu Di Shen’s power fountain.

The red Tu Di Shen then explains that, after losing the essence from the fountain, he would become weaker and weaker and eventually, die.

[the player decides to help the red Tu Di Shen, so the player heads to “Fantasia's” headquarters and tries to understand the reason the company interfered with villagers’ lives, as they can’t make money out of a poor village. ]

[more battles on the way]

After the player arrives at the company’s building, he finds out that the company is guarded by robotic armies, it’s strange for them to develop an army as the city is probably the safest place in the world.

[The player battles his way into the building, after a lot of battles, the player meets with the CEO of “Fantastia”]

The CEO explains to the player that they actually fully understand the power of Tu Di Shen, and how it works, as he believes that Tu Di Shen not only relies on the power of mythical essences but also the power of beliefs from the villagers, the reason of the company interfering with villagers’ lives is because of that. The company wants to experiment with the power of beliefs and they believe that if the human is able to utilize such power, they would be able to put people’s fate and future in human’s own hands.

The CEO asks the player to join him.
[The choices will be harder for the players in-game, as a lot of game player factors will affect player’s views, ultimately, the CEO is not meant to be portrayed as rather a villain or a hero.]


[Joins the CEO, Natural ending]
The player battles with the red Tu Di Shen and discovered that he was lying about dying, the Tu Di Shen will certainly lose its power, but it won't die because of the loss of power, and the player defeated the Tu Di Shen, developed red village furthermore along with his own village.
[Although people appreciated the technology enhancing the quality of their lives in many means, a lot of people miss the taste of Natural fruit, and the blue sky. The villages are now more like cities, just like the one Kiki wanted to escape from.]


[Disagree with the CEO, helps the Tu Di Shen, Natural ending]
The player disagrees with the CEO and fights him.
[This battle will be the hardest battle in the game, as the Tu Di Shen was nerfed hard due to its power loss.]
The player defeats the CEO, and brings the villagers back to the life they were living, Tu Di Shen now blesses people more often.
[Although people went back to the normal life of their past, and got even more rewards to worship Tu Di Shen, some people argue that their lives could be more convenient with technology, and they believe that people should embrace the future rather than fear it.]


[True endings - requires the player to meet with both Tu Di Shen and understand their perspectives on the CEO’s view]

The player convinced the CEO to make an agreement with Tu Di Shen, connecting the technology with nature, the red Tu Di Shen now gets to make use of the technology to bless people with better goodies and receive more beliefs. Everyone lives happily ever after.</p>
